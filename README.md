Doctor Appointment Analysis 
________________________________________
Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analysis hospital appointment data using SQL to understand patient appointment behaviour, no-show patterns, doctor workload, and department-wise performance.
The project focuses on extracting healthcare insights to improve scheduling efficiency and patient management.

Dataset Information
•	Source: Simulated healthcare dataset / Kaggle-style dataset
•	Tables Used:
o	patients
o	appointments
o	doctors
o	departments
•	Key Columns:
o	Patient ID, Age, Gender
o	Appointment Date, Appointment Status (Show / No-Show)
o	Doctor ID, Department
________________________________________
Tools & Technologies Used
•	Database Language: SQL
•	Concepts Used:
o	SELECT, WHERE
o	GROUP BY, HAVING
o	ORDER BY
o	INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
o	Aggregate Functions (COUNT, AVG)
o	Date & Time Functions
o	Subqueries

Data Preparation
•	Validated appointment records and patient details
•	Handled missing or inconsistent appointment statuses
•	Ensured accurate joins across patient, doctor, and department tables
•	Standardized date and time formats for analysis
________________________________________
Analysis Performed
•	Analysed appointment volume by department and doctor
•	Identified no-show rates across age groups and genders
•	Studied appointment trends by day and time
•	Evaluated doctor workload distribution
•	Analysed patient revisit patterns
________________________________________
Key Insights
•	Certain departments experienced higher no-show rates
•	No-shows were more frequent during specific time slots
•	Some doctors had significantly higher appointment loads
•	Older patients showed higher appointment adherence
________________________________________
 Final Output
•	SQL query results showing:
o	Department-wise appointment analysis
o	No-show rate calculations
o	Doctor workload summaries
•	Well-organized SQL scripts for healthcare analysis
________________________________________
Business Recommendations
•	Optimize appointment scheduling based on no-show trends
•	Implement reminder systems for high-risk no-show groups
•	Balance doctor workload across departments
•	Adjust appointment slots for peak and low attendance periods

Learnings
This project strengthened my ability to:
•	Analysis healthcare datasets using SQL
•	Work with time-based and status-driven data
•	Apply joins and aggregations in real-world scenarios
•	Translate operational problems into SQL solutions
